The Agrovoc Field module is a module for manually indexing nodes using Agrovoc concepts.
This module creates a new CCK field (called Agrovoc and derived from the Content Taxonomy field) that allows to select Agrovoc terms through an autocomplete textbox connecting to the Agrovoc web services 2.0.
Being a CCK field synchronized with a taxonomy, it allows to exploit both CCK and taxonomy features in Drupal.
The module has very good and very well integrated multi-lingual support: when indexing a node, the module lists Agrovoc terms in the website currently active language, but then stores the selected terms in all the languages enabled in the website. When switching to a different language, the corresponding Agrovoc terms in that language will be displayed and when translating a node that has already been indexed, the translated Agrovoc terms will be displayed and the autocomplete field will only list terms in that language.
The author of this module is already in contact with the author of another Agrovoc Drupal module (http://drupal.org/project/agrovoc) to coordinate on development.
Both modules derive from the same initial developments in CONDESAN and use the same basic functionalities (a common API), but the Agrovoc module only integrates Agrovoc with the Drupal taxonomy, while the Agrovoc Field module integates it also with CCK.
Coordination on the development of these two modules will probably lead to the release of a co-maintained module called "Agrovoc API" and two different interface modules. 
The next version of the module (or the next version of the Agrovoc API module) will include the option to use the Agrovoc SPARQL endpoint instead of the soon obsolete Agrovoc web services 2.0. 
It was developed by CONDESAN in coordination with the AIMS team in FAO and with the IT team in GFAR.
